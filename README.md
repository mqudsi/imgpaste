# imgpaste

`imgpaste` is a command-line utility that saves the (image) contents of the clipboard to an image file on-disk. It can be used after copying an image from a document or from the web, or after taking a screenshot (with the Snipping Tool via win+shift+s or via Print Screen). `imgpaste` supports JPEG, PNG, and Bitmap output file formats.

`imgpaste` was initially coded by Mahmoud Al-Qudsi during a live development session. The two-hour clip [can be viewed on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkIuXQytmOA) for a look at some of the challenges (and Windows bugs!) encountered during the process.
